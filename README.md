Outdated UI – Request for Modern Redesign
Description:
The current user interface of Sehat Line Academy feels outdated and lacks modern design standards. This impacts usability, accessibility, and overall user experience. A refreshed UI would make the platform more engaging, intuitive, and professional.
Problems Identified:
- Old‑fashioned layout with limited responsiveness on mobile and tablet devices.
- Inconsistent typography and color scheme.
- Navigation is cluttered and not user‑friendly.
- Lack of modern UI elements (cards, modals, animations, micro‑interactions).
- Accessibility issues (contrast, font sizes, ARIA roles missing).
Proposed Improvements:
- Adopt a modern UI framework (e.g., Material UI, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap 5).
- Implement a responsive design for seamless use across devices.
- Introduce a clean color palette with consistent typography.
- Redesign navigation with clear hierarchy and intuitive menus.
- Add interactive elements (hover states, transitions, tooltips).
- Ensure WCAG accessibility compliance.
Expected Outcome:
A modern, polished, and user‑friendly interface that improves usability, enhances student engagement, and reflects the professionalism of Sehat Line Academy.

Would you like me to also draft a mock UI concept (wireframe description) so developers/designers have a visual direction to follow?
